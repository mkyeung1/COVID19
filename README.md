<h1>COVID-19 Dashboard</h1>

<p>I explored and investigated COVID-19 datasets sourced from Our World in Data. By utilising SQL queries, I extracted various valuable pieces of information to understand the global pandemic's impact.</p>

<p>The result data from the COVID-19 datasets is presented in a comprehensive dashboard on Tableau Public. The interactive dashboard can be found <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/man.kwong.yeung/viz/CovidDashboard_17023280886080/Dashboard1">here</a>.
